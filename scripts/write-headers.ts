/**
 * Writes Netlify's `_headers` file into the build output.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The security headers in lib/csp.ts were only ever attached by the Express app,
 * which means they reached API responses and the dev server's index.html — but
 * not the deployed site. On Netlify the document and every hashed asset are
 * served straight from the CDN, so the page loaded with NO Content-Security-Policy
 * at all: the policy protecting the API was never applied to the app itself.
 *
 * Netlify reads `_headers` from the publish directory, which is the only place
 * these headers can be attached to static responses. Generating the file at
 * build time rather than hand-writing it keeps one source of truth: the policy
 * comes from the same `buildContentSecurityPolicy()` the server uses, including
 * the Clerk origin derived from VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY. A hand-written
 * policy would drift the moment a Clerk instance changed.
 *
 * Scripted so a missing value fails the build instead of silently shipping an
 * unlocked policy.
